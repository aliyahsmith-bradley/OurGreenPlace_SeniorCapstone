              <h5 class="card-title">Planting Trees</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Planting trees helps combat deforestation by sequestering carbon, supporting biodiversity, conserving soil, regulating water, improving air quality, creating economic opportunities, and providing cultural and aesthetic value. It is a multifaceted approach that addresses environmental, social, and economic challenges associated with deforestation.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">Buying Certified Wood Products</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Buying certified wood products helps combat deforestation by promoting sustainable forestry practices. Certification programs like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) ensure that wood products come from responsibly managed forests that prioritize conservation, biodiversity, and community engagement. By choosing certified wood, consumers support forest management that minimizes environmental impact, encourages reforestation, protects wildlife habitats, and respects the rights of local communities. This demand for certified wood incentivizes sustainable forest management practices, ultimately contributing to the preservation of forests and the mitigation of deforestation's negative effects on the environment.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Recycle and Buy Recycled Products</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Recycling and buying recycled products help combat deforestation by reducing the demand for new raw materials, such as wood and paper, derived from forests. By recycling materials like paper, cardboard, and wood products, we lessen the need to harvest trees for these purposes. Additionally, buying recycled products encourages the market for recycled materials, creating a cycle of sustainability that reduces pressure on natural forests, preserves biodiversity, and mitigates environmental degradation associated with deforestation.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Eating Sustainable Food</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Eating sustainable food helps combat deforestation because it reduces the demand for products linked to deforestation, such as cattle ranching and soy production. Sustainable agriculture practices prioritize forest conservation, biodiversity protection, and minimal land clearing, leading to less pressure on forests and their ecosystems. By choosing sustainably sourced foods, individuals contribute to preserving natural habitats, mitigating deforestation's harmful impacts on climate, wildlife, and indigenous communities, and promoting environmentally responsible food production methods.</p>
